# Breast Cancer Classification 🧬

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying breast cancer using a machine learning model. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an effective machine learning model to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features. The notebook includes:

- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training using various classifiers
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📂 Files

- `breast cancer.ipynb` — Main notebook with all steps from data loading to model evaluation.
- `README.md` — Project description and usage instructions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, commonly available via:
- [`sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)

It includes features like:
- Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- Target classes: `0 = malignant`, `1 = benign`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-classification.git
   cd breast-cancer-classification
